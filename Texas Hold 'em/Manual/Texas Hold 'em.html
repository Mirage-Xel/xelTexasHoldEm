                <p class="flavour-text">This manual can also be used to win at poker outside of bombs. Last month, I lost 500 dollars.</p>
               
                <p>You are at a poker table with five other players, whose names are written next to their two face-down 'hole' cards. Your hole cards are face-up, and your name is written as YOU.</p>
				<p>Use the last digit of the serial number modulo 6 to find the deck used by the module in the list below. Whenever this manual asks you to deal a card from the deck, remove it from the deck. Deal your two hole cards before dealing any others.</p><ul>

				<p>Find each other player's name in the table on page 3. Taking Alice as 1, shift each player down in the table by the index of the name associated with the corresponding character of the serial number in the table, starting with the player sitting to your left of your seat and going clockwise.</p>
                <p>In this order, deal each player's first card, then each player's second after all first cards have been dealt. When dealing cards, start from the most recently dealt card, e.g., +1 is the card immedately after it. Before any cards have been dealt, the most recenlty dealt card is your second (right) hole card.</p> 
				<p>Each time you deel a hole card for a player, use the next item in the sequence of values in their new row. This is kept between betting rounds.</p>
